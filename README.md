# Ryan Sales
<sub>Information Systems student at UFPI.</sub>

As a member of the research laboratory applied to computer vision and intelligence, I combine analytical skills, the ability to work in team environments and attention to detail, After spending the past few years applying vision and computational intelligence techniques to real-world problems,
I developed skills to solve problems in this aspect.

My credentials are a Bachelor's degree in information systems through the Federal University of Piauí.

**Background in:** Python, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Image Processing.

**complementary courses:**
*[UFPI]* Deep Learning: An Introduction to Convolutional Networks.
*[UFPI]* Developing RESTFul Applications Using Node.js.
*[UFPI]* Digital Processing of Medical Images with Python and Opencv.
*[UFPI]* High Availability Cluster with Docker Swarm.
*[UFPI]* Deep Learnig in images: applying CNNS with Keras and Tensorflow.
*[UFPI]* Processing and analysis of arcustic signals in usarban cenaruis with convnets.
